# The Chaos — Interactive

[The Chaos — Interactive](https://robertfmath.github.io/The-Chaos-Interactive) is an interactive web app that explores _The Chaos_, a famous poem written by Gerard Nolst Trenité in 1922 that humorously highlights the many irregularities in English pronunciation. The app provides click-to-pronounce functionality and integrated dictionary lookups for words that Trenité emphasizes, all within an easy-to-use and modern interface.
