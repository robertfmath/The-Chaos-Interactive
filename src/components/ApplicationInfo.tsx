            by Gerard Nolst Trenit√© is a poem that humorously highlights the
            many irregularities and inconsistencies in English pronunciation.

          In this interactive version of the poem, you can click on any blue
          word and hear its pronunciation. Hovering over the word reveals a
          button that links to its definition in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.

              Due to the interactive nature of this website, it is best
              experienced on a monitor rather than a phone or tablet.

              Words are pronounced using the browser&apos;s Web Speech API,
              which has limitations. To ensure accurate pronunciation, some
              words have been replaced with phonetic equivalents behind the
              scenes (e.g.,{" "}
              <Typography component="span" sx={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
                wind
              </Typography>{" "}
              was mapped to{" "}
              <Typography component="span" sx={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
                wined
              </Typography>
              ). These adjustments follow General American English.
            </Typography>
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item", pl: 1 }}>
            <Typography>
              Because of these phonetic substitutions, using voices from other
              dialects (e.g., British English) may lead to inaccurate
              pronunciations. In fact, this application was validated
              exclusively with the &quot;Google US English&quot; voice, so
              accuracy with any other voice cannot be guaranteed. The Google US
              English voice is typically available on desktop Chrome browsers.
            </Typography>
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item", pl: 1 }}>
            <Typography>
              Some words could not be correctly pronounced by the Google US
              English voice, even with phonetic tweaks. These words are
              underlined with a dotted red line; hovering over them will display
              a phonemic respelling from their Merriam-Webster dictionary entry.
            </Typography>

          <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item", pl: 1 }}>

              Some speakers, particularly Bluetooth speakers, may cut off the
              beginning of each word&apos;s pronunciation due to audio latency.
              If this occurs, consider using an alternative audio source (such
              as headphones).
